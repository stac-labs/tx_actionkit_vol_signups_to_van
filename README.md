# TX Volunteer Data from ActionKit to TDP VAN

## Overview

<p>This program moves data from ActionKit Signups (through the TX Dems volunteer page)
to MyC VAN. It either updates or finds the MyC profile in VAN, and applies either an SR or AC. Mappings are based
on input from the TX Dems.</p>  


<p>The workflow is for this script to run once evey day in DNC Script Runner to move the data from the day 
before from ActionKit to VAN</p>
